## 6. Resolution of Knowledge Gaps and Contradictions (Phase 4)

Several critical knowledge gaps and one major contradiction identified in Phase 0 have been resolved through targeted research and analysis.

### 6.1. Resolved Knowledge Gaps

- **G-001: Netflix CDN Bandwidth Consumption:** Resolved. Netflix accounts for ~15% of global internet traffic, with ~95% served via its proprietary Open Connect CDN. This strategy significantly reduces bandwidth costs, demonstrating that raw bandwidth costs are a major component, but can be optimized through strategic infrastructure investment [5].
- **G-003: FAST Channel CPM Rates:** Resolved. FAST channel CPMs range from $4-$15, with live content commanding higher rates. Ad loads typically range from 4-10 minutes per hour. Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI) has significantly improved ad fill rates and monetization efficiency [5].
- **G-004: AV1 Codec ROI Analysis:** Resolved. AV1 offers ~30% better efficiency than HEVC/VP9, leading to substantial bandwidth savings. Netflix's 30% adoption by Dec 2025, coupled with widespread device support, confirms its positive ROI despite higher encoding compute costs [5].
- **G-005: DRM Licensing Costs:** Resolved. While Widevine and FairPlay licenses are royalty-free, multi-DRM setup costs range from $10,000-$50,000, with monthly fees of $500-$5,000. These costs are driven by the complexity of key management and license delivery infrastructure [5].

### 6.2. Resolved Contradictions

- **C-001: Infrastructure CDN Cost Percentage:** Resolved. The contradiction between 
the claim of "70-90% of costs at scale = CDN/bandwidth" and a chart showing 32% for Multi-CDN was resolved. The higher figure refers to total video delivery costs (raw bandwidth + CDN), while the lower figure refers to specific Multi-CDN service fees. Netflix's Open Connect strategy demonstrates that significant optimization is possible, bringing total delivery costs closer to 60-70% for a standard platform, and even lower for highly optimized ones [5].
