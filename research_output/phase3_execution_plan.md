# PHASE 3: DEEP DIVE RESEARCH - EXECUTION PLAN

**Status:** ACTIVE - Beginning web research and data extraction
**Start Date:** 2026-02-17
**Approach:** Systematic source review with immediate data capture

---

## EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Priority Order (Quick Wins First)
1. **Domain 6 (Infrastructure)** - Vendor pricing pages readily accessible
2. **Domain 3 (Competitive)** - Platform earnings/disclosures available
3. **Domain 1 (Technology)** - Technical specifications published
4. **Domain 2 (Business Models)** - Mix of accessible and challenging sources
5. **Domain 7 (Regional)** - Some language barriers, scattered data
6. **Domain 5 (Content)** - Trade pub analysis required
7. **Domain 4 (User Behavior)** - Academic papers need deeper review

---

## SESSION 1: INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS (Domain 6)

### Target: 25-30 data points from vendor pricing pages

**Sources to Access:**
1. AWS MediaTailor pricing → SSAI costs per session
2. Stripe pricing → Payment processing fees
3. AWS MediaConvert pricing → Transcoding costs by resolution
4. Google Cloud Transcoder pricing → Alternative transcoding costs
5. AWS S3 pricing → Storage costs per GB
6. Mux pricing → Bundled video platform costs
7. Recurly pricing → Subscription management fees

**Expected Outputs:**
- 25-30 infrastructure cost data points
- HIGH confidence scores (official vendor pricing)
- Addresses G-009 (SSAI), G-010 (Payment), G-005 (DRM pricing exploration)

## SESSION 2: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE (Domain 3)

### Target: 25-30 data points from platform disclosures

**Sources to Access:**
1. Netflix Investor Relations → Subscriber count, ARPU, content spend
2. Disney Investor Relations → Disney+ metrics, churn indicators
3. Amazon 10-K → Prime Video allocation
4. Conviva State of Streaming → Engagement benchmarks
5. Sandvine report → Traffic share by platform

**Expected Outputs:**
- 25-30 competitive benchmark data points
- HIGH/MEDIUM confidence (official disclosures vs measurement reports)
- Addresses G-001 (Netflix CDN), G-002 (Disney+ churn), validates C-001 contradiction

---

## SESSION 3: TECHNOLOGY DISRUPTION (Domain 1)

### Target: 20-25 data points on emerging tech

**Sources to Access:**
1. Alliance for Open Media → AV1 specifications
2. Netflix Tech Blog → AV1 rollout, bandwidth savings
3. Cloudflare blog → Edge computing, AV1 support
4. WebRTC.org → WebRTC specifications

**Expected Outputs:**
- 20-25 technology data points
- HIGH/MEDIUM confidence
- Addresses G-004 (AV1 ROI)

---

## DATA CAPTURE WORKFLOW

For each source:
1. **Access** → Browse/fetch source content
2. **Extract** → Pull specific quantitative data points
3. **Score** → Assign confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
4. **Record** → Add to domain CSV with full attribution
5. **Update** → Mark source status in catalog
6. **Track** → Note data yield in MEMORY.md

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] 100+ total data points extracted (first batch)
- [ ] 70%+ HIGH confidence scores
- [ ] All 10 knowledge gaps addressed (at least partially)
- [ ] Source quality patterns documented
- [ ] Contradiction C-001 investigated with new data
