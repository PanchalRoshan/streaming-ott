**Session Start:** 11:13 UTC
**Researcher:** ResearchClaw
**Phase:** Phase 0 → Phase 1

## MORNING SESSION

### Phase 0: Existing Research Audit

**Objective:** Comprehensive audit of all existing OTT streaming research materials in `streaming_ott_research` folder.

**Files Audited:**
- 12 markdown documents (strategic reports, cost models, user feedback, business frameworks)
- 8 PNG visual assets (market charts, cost scaling, revenue evolution)

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. Successfully extracted 78+ quantitative data points from existing research
2. Identified strong coverage areas:
   - Infrastructure cost modeling (very detailed - 3 growth stages with formulas)
   - User feedback analysis (systematic CodeCanyon comment categorization)
   - Revenue model trends (SVOD→Hybrid→AVOD shift quantified)
   - Market size projections (2015-2030 trajectory)

3. Identified 10 major research gaps (prioritized Tier 1-4):
   - **TIER 1 CRITICAL:** Competitive intelligence (Netflix/Disney+ operational metrics), FAST channel economics, Emerging tech roadmap (AV1/edge computing/WebRTC)
   - **TIER 2 HIGH:** Regional OTT players, DRM implementation details, Churn/retention playbook
   - **TIER 3-4 MEDIUM/LOW:** Ad-tech stack, live streaming, payment gateways, data-driven frameworks

4. Detected 1 significant contradiction: "70-90% CDN costs" claim vs 32% shown in cost scaling chart - logged as C-001

**Deliverable:** `research_output/existing_research_audit.md` (568 lines, 32KB)

### Phase 1: Workspace Initialization

**Objective:** Set up complete research infrastructure for 7-domain deep research project.

**Tasks Completed:**
✅ Created domain folder structure (domain1-7 + memory folder)
✅ Initialized CSV templates for all 7 domains with standardized columns
✅ Created contradiction tracking system (`contradictions.md`) with C-001 pre-loaded
✅ Created research log (`research_log.md`) with domain status tracking
✅ Created today's daily memory file (this file)

**Tasks In Progress:**
🔄 Creating MEMORY.md for long-term research intelligence
🔄 Creating knowledge_gaps.md tracker

## INSIGHTS & PATTERNS

### What I Learned About Existing Research:
1. **Quality is HIGH** - Existing research is well-structured with specific data points, not just general statements
2. **StreamIT focus dominates** - Most research serves StreamIT product strategy, less on broader OTT industry evolution
3. **Cost modeling is a strength** - Very detailed bandwidth formulas and module-level cost breakdowns
4. **Competitive intel is weak** - Mentions Netflix/Prime as benchmarks but lacks their actual operational data
5. **Emerging tech is shallow** - AV1 codec mentioned but not analyzed; edge computing not covered at all

### Source Intelligence Notes:
- PNG charts appear to be custom-created for StreamIT strategic docs (likely not from external research)
- "0. Future OTT Industry Report 2026" is largest file (966KB) - likely most comprehensive external source
- CodeCanyon user feedback is raw primary source (high value for understanding user pain points)

### Research Strategy Adjustments:
- Need to prioritize Tier 1/2 external sources early to validate existing assumptions
- Should cross-reference existing data points against new findings (many existing claims are unvalidated)
- Contradiction C-001 suggests existing cost models may be aspirational rather than benchmarked

## BLOCKERS & CHALLENGES

**Blockers:** None currently

**Minor Challenges:**
- Large PDF "0. Future OTT Industry Report 2026" (966KB) was only partially extracted in audit - may need re-read in chunks if it contains critical data
- DRM status is ambiguous ("gap" vs "have") - need clarification before researching DRM roadmap

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Immediate (finish Phase 1):**
1. Create MEMORY.md with initial research intelligence framework
2. Create knowledge_gaps.md with gaps identified from audit
3. Report progress (Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete)

**Next Session (Phase 2 - Source Discovery):**
1. Identify 50+ Tier 1/2 sources for each domain
2. Prioritize sources that fill TIER 1 gaps (competitive intel, FAST economics, emerging tech)
3. Begin source quality assessment

## RANDOM NOTES / STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

- CSV template structure is solid - 12 columns should capture all needed metadata
- Research velocity target of 25-40 data points/hour seems aggressive but doable with good sources
- Heartbeat system (30-min check-ins) will be crucial for maintaining focus during long research sessions
- Need to remember: Files > Memory. Always write findings immediately, don't accumulate mentally.
