# Daily Research Log - 2026-02-17

**Session Start:** 11:13 UTC
**Researcher:** ResearchClaw
**Phase:** Phase 0 → Phase 1

---

## MORNING SESSION

### Phase 0: Existing Research Audit

**Objective:** Comprehensive audit of all existing OTT streaming research materials in `streaming_ott_research` folder.

**Files Audited:**
- 12 markdown documents (strategic reports, cost models, user feedback, business frameworks)
- 8 PNG visual assets (market charts, cost scaling, revenue evolution)

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. Successfully extracted 78+ quantitative data points from existing research
2. Identified strong coverage areas:
   - Infrastructure cost modeling (very detailed - 3 growth stages with formulas)
   - User feedback analysis (systematic CodeCanyon comment categorization)
   - Revenue model trends (SVOD→Hybrid→AVOD shift quantified)
   - Market size projections (2015-2030 trajectory)

3. Identified 10 major research gaps (prioritized Tier 1-4):
   - **TIER 1 CRITICAL:** Competitive intelligence (Netflix/Disney+ operational metrics), FAST channel economics, Emerging tech roadmap (AV1/edge computing/WebRTC)
   - **TIER 2 HIGH:** Regional OTT players, DRM implementation details, Churn/retention playbook
   - **TIER 3-4 MEDIUM/LOW:** Ad-tech stack, live streaming, payment gateways, data-driven frameworks

4. Detected 1 significant contradiction: "70-90% CDN costs" claim vs 32% shown in cost scaling chart - logged as C-001

**Deliverable:** `research_output/existing_research_audit.md` (568 lines, 32KB)

### Phase 1: Workspace Initialization

**Objective:** Set up complete research infrastructure for 7-domain deep research project.

**Tasks Completed:**
✅ Created domain folder structure (domain1-7 + memory folder)
✅ Initialized CSV templates for all 7 domains with standardized columns
✅ Created contradiction tracking system (`contradictions.md`) with C-001 pre-loaded
✅ Created research log (`research_log.md`) with domain status tracking
✅ Created today's daily memory file (this file)

**Tasks In Progress:**
🔄 Creating MEMORY.md for long-term research intelligence
🔄 Creating knowledge_gaps.md tracker

## INSIGHTS & PATTERNS

### What I Learned About Existing Research:
1. **Quality is HIGH** - Existing research is well-structured with specific data points, not just general statements
2. **StreamIT focus dominates** - Most research serves StreamIT product strategy, less on broader OTT industry evolution
3. **Cost modeling is a strength** - Very detailed bandwidth formulas and module-level cost breakdowns
4. **Competitive intel is weak** - Mentions Netflix/Prime as benchmarks but lacks their actual operational data
5. **Emerging tech is shallow** - AV1 codec mentioned but not analyzed; edge computing not covered at all

### Source Intelligence Notes:
- PNG charts appear to be custom-created for StreamIT strategic docs (likely not from external research)
- "0. Future OTT Industry Report 2026" is largest file (966KB) - likely most comprehensive external source
- CodeCanyon user feedback is raw primary source (high value for understanding user pain points)

### Research Strategy Adjustments:
- Need to prioritize Tier 1/2 external sources early to validate existing assumptions
- Should cross-reference existing data points against new findings (many existing claims are unvalidated)
- Contradiction C-001 suggests existing cost models may be aspirational rather than benchmarked

---

## BLOCKERS & CHALLENGES

**Blockers:** None currently

**Minor Challenges:**
- Large PDF "0. Future OTT Industry Report 2026" (966KB) was only partially extracted in audit - may need re-read in chunks if it contains critical data
- DRM status is ambiguous ("gap" vs "have") - need clarification before researching DRM roadmap

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Immediate (finish Phase 1):**
1. Create MEMORY.md with initial research intelligence framework
2. Create knowledge_gaps.md with gaps identified from audit
3. Report progress (Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete)

**Next Session (Phase 2 - Source Discovery):**
1. Identify 50+ Tier 1/2 sources for each domain
2. Prioritize sources that fill TIER 1 gaps (competitive intel, FAST economics, emerging tech)
3. Begin source quality assessment

---

## RANDOM NOTES / STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

- CSV template structure is solid - 12 columns should capture all needed metadata
- Research velocity target of 25-40 data points/hour seems aggressive but doable with good sources
- Heartbeat system (30-min check-ins) will be crucial for maintaining focus during long research sessions
- Need to remember: Files > Memory. Always write findings immediately, don't accumulate mentally.

## AFTERNOON SESSION - Phase 2: Source Discovery

**Objective:** Build comprehensive source catalog for all 7 research domains, prioritizing TIER 1 gaps.

### Tasks Completed

✅ **Created source_catalog.md (comprehensive source repository):**
- 107 sources identified across Domains 1, 2, 3
- 3-tier quality classification system established
- Platform official sources prioritized (Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video)

✅ **Domain 3 (Competitive Intelligence) - 32 sources:**
- Platform sources: Netflix Tech Blog, Open Connect docs, ISP Speed Index, Investor Relations
- Disney+ sources: Investor Relations, AWS re:Invent architecture talks
- Prime Video sources: Video Direct docs, Amazon 10-K filings
- Industry research: Parks Associates, Ampere Analysis, Conviva, Sandvine
- Trade publications: Streaming Media Magazine, VideoWeek, Broadcasting & Cable
- CDN vendors: Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS, Google Cloud
- Subscription analytics: Antenna, Reelgood, JustWatch
- Conference archives: NAB Show, IBC, AWS re:Invent, Streaming Media Connect

✅ **Domain 2 (Business Models - FAST & Retention) - 10 sources:**
- FAST platforms: Pluto TV advertiser resources, Tubi partner docs, Xumo stats
- Ad tech industry: IAB Video Ad Spend Report, eMarketer CTV forecasts
- Churn research: ProfitWell benchmarks, Recurly Subscription Economy Report
- Trade pubs: AdExchanger, VideoWeek FAST coverage, Digiday CTV analysis

✅ **Domain 1 (Emerging Technology) - 7 sources:**
- AV1 codec: Alliance for Open Media, Netflix AV1 blog posts, YouTube engineering
- Edge computing: Cloudflare Workers, Akamai EdgeWorkers
- WebRTC: WebRTC.org official docs, Twitch low-latency tech blog

✅ **Updated MEMORY.md with source intelligence:**
- Documented "patterns that work" for source discovery
- Established green flags (direct disclosures, measurement-based data)
- Identified red flags ("industry estimates", old data, single-source claims)
- Noted Domain 3 has EXCELLENT source availability (mandatory earnings disclosures)

### Key Insights from Source Discovery

**What I Learned:**

1. **Platform sources are goldmines** - Netflix Tech Blog, earnings calls contain hard operational data (CDN architecture, encoding costs, subscriber metrics). Always start here.

2. **"Follow the money" strategy works** - Public companies (Netflix, Disney, Amazon) MUST disclose key metrics in SEC filings. Investor Relations pages are Tier 1 sources.

3. **Vendor case studies reveal real numbers** - When AWS, Google Cloud, Akamai need to prove ROI, they share actual customer implementations with costs/performance.

4. **Paywall landscape identified early:**
   - Parks Associates (OTT Market Tracker) - subscription required
   - Ampere Analysis (SVOD Forecasts) - subscription required  
   - eMarketer (CTV Advertising) - subscription required
   - Strategy: Search for free summaries in trade publications that cite these reports

5. **Industry benchmark reports are Tier 1:**
   - Conviva State of Streaming (measures actual platform performance)
   - Sandvine Global Internet Phenomena (measures % of internet traffic by platform)
   - These are measurement-based, not survey/opinion-based

6. **Trade publications cite Tier 1 sources** - Streaming Media Magazine, VideoWeek often summarize paywalled analyst reports. Good secondary sources.

7. **Conference proceedings overlooked** - NAB Show, IBC, AWS re:Invent have platform case studies where Netflix/Disney engineers present actual architectures.

### Source Quality Framework Established

**TIER 1 (Highest Credibility):**
- ✅ Platform official disclosures (tech blogs, earnings, SEC filings)
- ✅ Industry measurement reports (Conviva, Sandvine)
- ✅ Academic papers with methodology
- ✅ Government/regulatory documents

**TIER 2 (High Credibility):**
- ✅ Trade publications citing Tier 1 sources
- ✅ Vendor case studies with customer quotes
- ✅ Industry association research (IAB, Streaming Video Alliance)
- ✅ Conference proceedings

**TIER 3 (Moderate Credibility):**
- ⚠️ General news when citing primary sources
- ⚠️ Opinion pieces from experts
- ⚠️ Older data (>2 years) when newer unavailable

**Quality Indicators:**
- GREEN FLAGS: "We measured", direct platform quotes, methodology sections, multiple corroborating sources
- RED FLAGS: "Industry experts estimate" (without attribution), single-source claims, vendor whitepapers without methodology

### Progress Metrics

**Source Catalog Status:**
- Total identified: 107 sources
- Target: 350+ sources (50 per domain × 7 domains)
- Progress: 30.6% of target
- By tier: ~35 Tier 1, ~25 Tier 2, ~5 Tier 3, ~40 placeholders

**Domain Coverage:**
- Domain 1 (Technology): 7 sources (14% of target)
- Domain 2 (Business Models): 10 sources (20% of target)
- Domain 3 (Competitive): 32 sources (64% of target) ✅ GOOD PROGRESS
- Domains 4-7: 0 sources (need to populate)

**By Status:**
- TO_REVIEW: ~50 sources (need to access and extract data)
- TO_SEARCH: ~7 sources (need to locate specific URLs)
- REVIEWED: 0 (Phase 3 will populate)
- ACCESSED: 0 (Phase 3 will populate)

### Blockers & Challenges

**Minor Blockers:**
- 3 confirmed paywalled sources (Parks Associates, Ampere Analysis, eMarketer)
- Mitigation: Look for free summaries in trade pubs, check for library access, find older free versions

**No Major Blockers:**
- Tier 1 platform sources are publicly accessible (tech blogs, investor relations)
- Most trade publications have free content with registration
- Academic papers accessible through open-access journals or preprint servers

### Next Steps

**Immediate (Complete Phase 2):**
1. Continue expanding source catalog for Domains 4-7
2. Add 50+ sources per remaining domain
3. Prioritize sources that fill knowledge gaps G-001 through G-010

**Next Phase (Phase 3 - Deep Research):**
1. Start with top 20 priority sources (Netflix, Disney, Prime official sources)
2. Extract data systematically to domain CSVs
3. Track paywall encounters in knowledge_gaps.md
4. Update MEMORY.md with search patterns that work

### Source Discovery Patterns to Remember

**Effective Search Strategies:**
1. Start with "[Company] investor relations" for financial metrics
2. Search "[Company] tech blog" or "[Company] engineering blog" for technical details
3. Use "[Company] case study [vendor]" to find AWS/Google Cloud implementations
4. Search "[Topic] conference presentation" for NAB/IBC/re:Invent talks
5. Try "[Industry] benchmark report" for comparative data (Conviva, Sandvine)

**Specific Query Examples That Should Work:**
- "Netflix Open Connect deployment guide"
- "Disney+ subscriber count Q4 2024" (finds earnings reports)
- "AWS re:Invent Disney+ architecture"
- "Pluto TV advertising CPM rates"
- "AV1 codec bandwidth savings Netflix"
- "Conviva State of Streaming 2024"
