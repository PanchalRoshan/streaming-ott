**Date:** February 2026
**Credibility:** Tier 1 (Official Tech Blogs) & Tier 2 (Industry Analysis)

## Video Codec Evolution (AV1)

| Metric | Value | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Netflix AV1 Adoption** | 30% of all viewing (Dec 2025) | Netflix Tech Blog |
| **AV1 Efficiency Gain** | ~30% better than HEVC/VP9 | Industry Benchmark |
| **YouTube AV1 Support** | Launched for popular live streams (2025) | Meta White Paper |
| **Device Support** | Most mid-to-high end Smart TVs (2025) | Streaming Media |

### Key Insights
- **AV1 Milestone:** Netflix reached 30% adoption, making it their second most-used codec.
- **WebRTC Default:** Mozilla began defaulting to AV1 for all WebRTC calls in early 2025.
- **Future Roadmap:** Industry is already looking toward AV2 for further efficiency gains.

## Edge Computing & Infrastructure

| Technology | Impact/Metric | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heavy Edge Nodes** | 100 Gbps bandwidth per node | Tulix Blog |
| **Latency Reduction** | Up to 54.5% reduction via WebRTC optimization | SIGCOMM 25 Paper |
| **Edge Use Cases** | Personalization, SSAI, and low-latency delivery | Vucos.io |

### Key Insights
- **Decentralization:** Moving compute to the "heavy edge" allows for real-time processing of personalization and ad-insertion without round-trips to central clouds.
- **QoE Gains:** Edge computing is directly linked to improved Quality of Experience (QoE) and user engagement.

## Low-Latency Protocols (WebRTC vs LL-HLS)

| Protocol | Latency | Scalability | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WebRTC** | < 500ms (often 250ms) | Peer-to-peer / SFU | Interactive, Real-time |
| **LL-HLS** | 2s - 5s | High (HTTP-based) | Large-scale Live Events |
| **MOQ** | Sub-second | High (Media over QUIC) | Emerging Standard |

### Key Insights
- **WebRTC Scaling:** New architectures in 2025 are enabling WebRTC for large-scale live streaming, reducing latency by over 50% compared to traditional methods.
- **Twitch 2K:** Twitch launched 1440p (2K) streaming in beta (2025) to improve clarity for high-motion content.

## AI & Personalization

- **Customized Paths:** AI is being used to customize "watching paths" through advanced recommendation algorithms (Oxagile).
- **Predictive Analytics:** Most impactful use cases in 2025 include title matching, audience insights, and predictive churn modeling (SymphonyAI).
