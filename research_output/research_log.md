## SESSION LOG

### 2026-02-17 Session 1

**Time:** 11:13 UTC
**Phase:** Phase 0 & Phase 1
**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 0: Complete audit of existing research (12 MD files + 8 PNG images)
- ✅ Extracted 78 quantitative data points from existing research
- ✅ Identified 10 major research gaps
- ✅ Created comprehensive audit report (568 lines, 32KB)
- ✅ Phase 1: Created domain folder structure (7 domains + memory)
- ✅ Initialized CSV templates for all 7 domains
- ✅ Set up contradiction tracking system with C-001 logged
- ✅ Created research log, MEMORY.md, knowledge gaps tracker
- ✅ Finalized Phase 1 workspace initialization

**Blockers:** None

### 2026-02-17 Session 2

**Time:** 11:22 UTC
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Source Discovery
**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive source catalog (source_catalog.md)
- ✅ Identified 107 sources across 3 priority domains (D1, D2, D3)
- ✅ Established 3-tier source quality system
- ✅ Cataloged key platform sources: Netflix (Tech Blog, Investor Relations, Open Connect), Disney+, Prime Video
- ✅ Identified major industry research firms (Parks Associates, Ampere Analysis, Conviva, Sandvine)
- ✅ Cataloged trade publications (Streaming Media Magazine, VideoWeek, AdExchanger)
- ✅ Documented CDN vendor resources (Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS, Google Cloud)
- ✅ Updated MEMORY.md with source discovery patterns and quality assessment criteria

**Blockers:**
- Identified 3+ paywalled sources (Parks Associates, Ampere Analysis, eMarketer)
- Will need alternative approaches or free summaries

**Next Steps:**
- Continue expanding source catalog to 350+ (50 per domain × 7 domains)
- Add sources for Domains 4-7 (User Behavior, Content Strategy, Infrastructure, Regional)
- Begin Phase 3: Review priority sources and extract data
