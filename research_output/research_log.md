### 2026-02-17 Session 2

**Time:** 11:22 UTC
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Source Discovery
**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive source catalog (source_catalog.md)
- ✅ Identified 107 sources across 3 priority domains (D1, D2, D3)
- ✅ Established 3-tier source quality system
- ✅ Cataloged key platform sources: Netflix (Tech Blog, Investor Relations, Open Connect), Disney+, Prime Video
- ✅ Identified major industry research firms (Parks Associates, Ampere Analysis, Conviva, Sandvine)

- ✅ Documented CDN vendor resources (Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS, Google Cloud)
- ✅ Updated MEMORY.md with source discovery patterns and quality assessment criteria

**Blockers:**
- Identified 3+ paywalled sources (Parks Associates, Ampere Analysis, eMarketer)
- Will need alternative approaches or free summaries

**Next Steps:**
- Continue expanding source catalog to 350+ (50 per domain × 7 domains)
- Add sources for Domains 4-7 (User Behavior, Content Strategy, Infrastructure, Regional)
- Begin Phase 3: Review priority sources and extract data

### 2026-02-17 Session 4

**Time:** [Current Session]
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Deep Dive Research ATTEMPT
**Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKER ENCOUNTERED

**Tasks Attempted:**
- ❌ Attempted to access AWS MediaTailor pricing (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ❌ Attempted to access Stripe pricing (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ❌ Attempted to access Netflix Open Connect (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ❌ Attempted to access Alliance for Open Media (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ✅ Successfully accessed GitHub code search
- ✅ Found krzemienski/awesome-video repository with extensive video streaming resources

**Critical Blocker Identified:**
The GitHub Actions environment has strict access restrictions that block most commercial and industry websites. This prevents direct web research for Phase 3.

**Blocked Domain Categories:**
1. Cloud vendor pricing pages (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
2. Platform official sources (Netflix, Disney+, streaming services)
3. Industry organizations (AOM, DASH-IF, etc.)
4. Many commercial websites and CDN vendors

**Alternative Strategy Required:**
Since direct web browsing is blocked, Phase 3 needs a completely different approach:

**Option 1: GitHub-Based Research**
- Search GitHub repositories for research data, technical specifications
- Extract quantitative findings from open-source documentation
- Parse technical standards documents stored in repos
- Analyze code comments and README files for performance benchmarks

**Option 2: Academic Paper Access**
- Access arXiv or similar open repositories for papers
- Extract data from research publications
- Find technical specifications in open standards documents

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Combine Phase 0 existing research (78 data points already extracted)
- GitHub-sourced technical data
- Academic paper data
- Focus on what's accessible rather than blocked sources

**Impact Assessment:**
- Cannot access ~80% of cataloged sources (commercial websites)
- Original Phase 3 plan (direct web research) is not viable
- Need user guidance on proceeding with available sources only
- May need to significantly reduce scope or change execution environment

**Recommendation:**
Wait for user guidance before continuing Phase 3. The current environment limitations make the original research plan impossible to execute as designed.

**Blockers:**
- CRITICAL: Web access severely restricted in GitHub Actions environment
- STATUS: Halted Phase 3 pending user guidance
