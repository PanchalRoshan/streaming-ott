### 2026-02-17 Session 4

**Time:** [Session Complete]
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Deep Dive Research ATTEMPT → BLOCKER DOCUMENTED → HANDOFF CREATED
**Status:** ✅ HANDOFF DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Tasks Attempted:**
- ❌ Attempted to access AWS MediaTailor pricing (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ❌ Attempted to access Stripe pricing (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ❌ Attempted to access Netflix Open Connect (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ❌ Attempted to access Alliance for Open Media (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)
- ✅ Successfully accessed GitHub code search
- ✅ Found krzemienski/awesome-video repository with extensive video streaming resources

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Comprehensive web access blocker analysis documented (WEB_ACCESS_BLOCKER_ANALYSIS.md)
- ✅ Updated README.md with blocker status
- ✅ Prepared alternative research strategies (3 options documented)
- ✅ Stored memory of web access restrictions for future sessions
- ✅ Demonstrated GitHub MCP alternative method (Netflix Q1 2024 earnings data)
- ✅ Created comprehensive handoff document for web-capable agent (HANDOFF_TO_WEB_AGENT.md)

**Critical Blocker Identified:**
The GitHub Actions environment has strict access restrictions that block most commercial and industry websites. This prevents direct web research for Phase 3.

**Blocked Domain Categories:**
1. Cloud vendor pricing pages (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) - 80%+ of sources
2. Platform official sources (Netflix, Disney+, streaming services)
3. Industry organizations (AOM, DASH-IF, etc.)
4. Many commercial websites and CDN vendors

**Impact Assessment:**
- Cannot access ~280-300 of 350 cataloged sources (80-85%)
- Original Phase 3 plan (direct web research) is not viable in current environment
- Original target of 700+ data points requires unrestricted web access

**Resolution - Handoff to Web-Capable Agent:**

User requested creation of handoff documentation for a web-capable agent to execute Phase 3. Successfully created:

**HANDOFF_TO_WEB_AGENT.md (565 lines)**
- Complete summary of Phases 0-2 work (78 data points, 350 sources)
- Critical files list with purposes (source_catalog.md, knowledge_gaps.md, CSVs)
- Systematic workflow with priority order (Domain 6→3→1→remaining)
- CSV format specification (12 columns) + confidence scoring rules
- 10 critical knowledge gaps mapped to specific sources
- Quality framework and success criteria
- Quick start checklist for next agent

**Value Delivered:**
- ✅ Foundation work 100% complete (Phases 0-2: audit, infrastructure, source catalog)
- ✅ Clear handoff documentation enables continuation in web-capable environment
- ✅ All research methodology, quality standards, and execution strategy documented
- ✅ Path forward for 700+ data point extraction clearly defined

**Blockers:**
- RESOLVED: Web access blocker documented with handoff strategy
- STATUS: Ready for web-capable agent to execute Phase 3
- NEXT: Web-capable agent follows HANDOFF_TO_WEB_AGENT.md instructions

**Deliverables Created:**
- `WEB_ACCESS_BLOCKER_ANALYSIS.md` (438 lines comprehensive analysis)
- `netflix_financial_data_fetcher.md` (150 lines - GitHub MCP method demo)
- `HANDOFF_TO_WEB_AGENT.md` (565 lines - complete handoff document)
- Updated `README.md` with blocker status
- Updated tracking files
