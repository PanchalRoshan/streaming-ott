- ✅ Identified 10 major research gaps
- ✅ Created comprehensive audit report (568 lines, 32KB)
- ✅ Phase 1: Created workspace structure
- ✅ Initialized CSV templates for 4 domains (D1, D2, D3, D6)
- ✅ Set up contradiction tracking system with C-001 logged

## HEARTBEAT LOG

Format: `## HEARTBEAT [HH:MM] | Domain: X | Task: Y | Progress: Z% | Blockers: [List]`

(Heartbeats will be logged here during active research sessions - every 30 minutes)

---

## MAJOR MILESTONES

- **2026-02-17 11:13 UTC:** Phase 0 complete - Existing research audit delivered
- **2026-02-17 11:45 UTC:** Phase 1 complete - Workspace initialized, ready for Phase 2

## VELOCITY METRICS

(Will be tracked starting Phase 3 - Deep Research)

**Target:** 25-40 data points per hour
**Tier 1/2 sources:** >70% of all sources

---

## NOTES

- All daily research notes go to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term learnings and source intelligence go to `MEMORY.md` (root folder)
- Contradictions tracked separately in `contradictions.md`
- Knowledge gaps tracked in `knowledge_gaps.md`
- Python helper scripts go in `scripts/` folder
- Checkpoints saved to `archive/` folder
