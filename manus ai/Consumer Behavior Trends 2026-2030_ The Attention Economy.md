# Consumer Behavior Trends 2026-2030: The Attention Economy

## The 6-Hour Ceiling
The average US consumer's daily entertainment time has hit a "ceiling" of approximately **6 hours**. As this total time is not growing, the competition between SVOD, social video, gaming, and podcasts has become a zero-sum game (Source: Deloitte).

## Generational Shifts & Cord-Cutting
- **Gen Z & Millennials**: Leading the charge in "cord-cutting 2.0." Approximately **23% of Gen Z** and **18% of Millennials** with cable intend to cancel in 2026, primarily due to cost ($125/mo for cable vs. $69/mo for 4 streaming services) (Source: Deloitte).
- **Social Video Dominance**: Social platforms are now the primary discovery and consumption engine for younger audiences. 61% of Gen Z watch movie/TV clips on social media weekly, creating significant disruption potential for full-length content (Source: Deloitte/CivicScience).

## Subscription Fatigue & Value Optimization
- **Churn-and-Return**: 8 in 10 Gen Z streamers have signed up for a service to watch a specific show and then canceled/paused it within the year. 37% have canceled due to fatigue (Source: CivicScience).
- **Social Integration Demand**: 63% of Gen Z subscribers are likely to subscribe to platforms that offer social features like live chat or virtual watch parties (Source: CivicScience).
- **The "Essential" Shift**: Consumers are re-evaluating streaming as a discretionary rather than essential expense. With half of US households reporting no money left after monthly expenses, platforms are forced to compete on "value optimization" (Source: Deloitte).
- **Ad-Supported Migration**: Virtually all major SVOD platforms have successfully integrated ad-supported tiers. 52% of Gen Z streamers already use ad-supported tiers, representing a high-value audience for advertisers in travel and finance (Source: Nielsen/Deloitte/CivicScience).

## Platform Engagement Patterns
- **YouTube's Dominance**: YouTube has become the single largest "channel" on the TV screen, reaching a record **12.5% share** of all TV viewing in 2025 (Source: Nielsen).
