# Business Model Evolution Forecast: 2026-2035

## The Great Revenue Flip (2027)
A critical industry milestone is projected for **2027**, when global consumer revenue from OTT video (SVOD and TVOD) will exceed traditional pay TV revenue for the first time (Source: PwC).

## SVOD to AVOD/Hybrid Transition
- **AVOD Growth**: Ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) is projected to grow from 20% of segment revenue in 2020 to **27.1% by 2029** (Source: PwC).
- **Hybrid Dominance**: The market is shifting toward hybrid models where ad tolerance is the primary trade-off for lower subscription costs. 70% of platforms already utilize some form of AVOD (Source: Bitmovin/Mordor).
- **Sachet Pricing**: In emerging markets, "sachet" (micro-payment) models are expected to drive mobile OTT adoption (Source: Mordor).

## The CTV Advertising Surge
- **CTV vs. Broadcast**: Connected TV (CTV) ad revenue, which was only 5.9% of traditional broadcast in 2020, is projected to surge to **44.7% by 2029** (Source: PwC).
- **SME Accessibility**: Generative AI is lowering the barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access CTV advertising, previously reserved for large brands (Source: PwC).

## AI-Driven Economic Transformation (2030+)
- **Production Efficiency**: Generative AI is projected to reduce production costs by 10-30% across the media industry by 2030, enabling smaller players to compete with major studios (Source: Morgan Stanley).
- **AI Market Growth**: The global AI in media & entertainment market is expected to reach **$99.48 billion by 2030**, reflecting a massive shift toward AI-driven personalization and automated content generation (Source: Grand View Research).

## Market Maturity & Value Optimization (2030+)
- **US Market Saturation**: US subscription growth will slow, reaching **765 million subscriptions by 2030**. Future growth will depend on "value optimization" rather than new household acquisition (Source: Parks Associates).
- **Revenue Stabilization**: Total US subscription revenue is projected to reach **$190.7 billion by 2030**, reflecting a mature market focused on ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) growth through bundling and ad-tier migration (Source: Parks Associates).
