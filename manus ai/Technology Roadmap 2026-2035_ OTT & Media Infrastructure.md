# Technology Roadmap 2026-2035: OTT & Media Infrastructure

## 2026: The Year of AI Integration & Connectivity Breakthroughs

### AI & Automation
- **AI Agents as Standard**: AI agents will transition from experimental to standard in business and media workflows, automating repetitive tasks and optimizing backend operations (Source: IEEE).
- **Autonomous Power Grids**: Datacenters supporting high-demand AI and streaming workloads will adopt AI-driven, predictive energy management to reduce carbon footprints and costs (Source: IEEE).

### Connectivity & Delivery
- **Satellite Direct-to-Cell**: 2026 marks the broad adoption of satellite-to-device communications, expanding streaming reach to previously unconnected populations and improving reliability for mobile users (Source: IEEE).
- **AV2 Codec Entry**: The AV2 specification enters public review and early implementation phases, promising further bandwidth efficiency beyond AV1. Final release is targeted for end of 2025/early 2026 (Source: AOMedia/Streaming Media).
- **AV1 Ubiquity**: AV1 reaches critical mass, already accounting for 30% of Netflix traffic and 70% of Meta's video consumption as of early 2026. However, broad industry implementation for VOD still lags at ~8-10% (Source: AOMedia/Bitmovin).

### Immersive & 3D Media
- **Polygonal Mesh Coding (PMC)**: AOMedia's PMC standard emerges as a critical enabler for 3D volumetric content, supporting the metaverse, AR/VR, and interactive gaming (Source: AOMedia).

## 2027-2030: Scaling & Security Evolution

### Infrastructure & Security
- **Cost Control as Top Priority**: 38% of video developers cite cost control as their #1 concern, driving investment in more efficient encoding and AI-driven workflow optimization (Source: Bitmovin).
- **Technical Glass Ceiling**: Infrastructure readiness becomes the primary bottleneck for AI-driven media applications. Companies must modernize to avoid "stifling AI growth" (Source: Cloudflare).
- **Post-Quantum Readiness**: Security roadmaps shift toward post-quantum cryptography to protect content and user data against future threats (Source: Cloudflare).

## 2031-2035: The Agentic & Immersive Era
- **AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Maturity**: By 2035, AI-driven content creation is expected to be a standard part of the production pipeline, with $10B of US original content spend addressable by AI as early as 2030 (Source: McKinsey).
- **Immersive Sports Viewing**: Smart glasses and gaming-style presentations become the standard for sports consumption, with media rights for top leagues hitting $96.3B by 2035 (Source: The Athletic/TM Broadcast).
- **Ubiquitous Streaming Hardware**: The streaming devices market reaches $61.3B by 2035, reflecting the total transition of the global population to internet-based media consumption (Source: Research Nester).

### Personalization & Delivery
- **Serverless Personalization**: Use of serverless computing at the edge for real-time, personalized stream manifest generation becomes the industry standard, moving away from static CDN delivery (Source: Cloudflare/Conviva).
- **Outcome-Based Evaluation**: Media platforms shift from simple metrics (views/clicks) to outcome-based agent evaluation, focusing on consumer-AI agent interaction patterns (Source: Conviva).
