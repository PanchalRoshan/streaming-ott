# The Future of OTT Streaming: A Foresight Analysis (2026-2035)

**February 18, 2026** | **Manus AI**

## Executive Summary

The global media landscape is in the midst of a profound transformation, driven by technological innovation, evolving consumer behaviors, and new economic realities. The Over-the-Top (OTT) streaming market, having reached a historic milestone by eclipsing traditional broadcast and cable viewership in 2025 [4], is now entering a new phase of evolution. This analysis synthesizes data from over a dozen industry reports and forecasts to provide a comprehensive outlook on the key trends, strategic shifts, and market projections that will define the media ecosystem from 2026 to 2035. We project a future characterized by a **$2.23 trillion global market** [32], the universal adoption of AI-driven content and delivery, and a fundamental reshaping of the competitive landscape.

## Key Quantitative Projections (2026-2035)

The coming decade will witness exponential growth and significant shifts in revenue models. The global video streaming market is projected to grow from **$364.7 billion in 2026 to $2.23 trillion by 2035** [32]. This growth will be accompanied by a critical inversion in revenue streams, with global OTT consumer spending surpassing traditional pay TV for the first time in 2027 [25].

| Metric | Current Value (2024-2026) | Projected Value | Target Year | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Global Video Streaming Market | $364.7B (2026) | $2.23T | 2035 | [32] |
| Global OTT Market | $383.52B (2026) | $626.69B | 2031 | [30] |
| AI in Media & Entertainment | $25.98B (2024) | $99.48B | 2030 | [33] |
| Sports Media Rights Revenue | $22B (2015) | $96.3B | 2035 | [35] |
| AVOD Revenue Share | 20% (2020) | 27.1% | 2029 | [24] |
| CTV Ad Revenue Share of Broadcast | 5.9% (2020) | 44.7% | 2029 | [26] |
| US Subscription TV/Video Revenue | $186.5B (2025) | $190.7B | 2030 | [28] |

## Technology Roadmap: The Agentic & Immersive Era

The technological underpinnings of the media industry will evolve dramatically, moving from static delivery to a dynamic, AI-powered, and immersive paradigm.

By **2026**, the industry will see the broad adoption of satellite-to-device connectivity, improving reach and reliability [3]. The AV2 video codec will enter public review, promising greater efficiency [7], while its predecessor, AV1, achieves ubiquity with major platforms like Netflix and Meta reporting 30% and 70% traffic share, respectively [8, 9]. However, broader industry adoption for VOD remains a challenge, lagging at around 8-10% [21].

Looking toward **2030 and beyond**, the focus will shift to scaling infrastructure and deploying AI. Infrastructure readiness will become a critical bottleneck, with a "technical glass ceiling" potentially stifling AI growth if not addressed [14]. By 2035, AI-generated content (AIGC) will be a standard component of production, with projections suggesting **$10 billion of US original content spend will be addressable by AI as early as 2030** [36]. This will be complemented by a surge in immersive sports viewing experiences and a **$61.3 billion market for streaming devices** [37], cementing the transition to an all-IP media environment.

## Consumer Behavior: The Attention Economy Matures

Consumer attention has become the most valuable and fiercely contested resource. The average US consumer's daily entertainment time has plateaued at approximately **six hours**, creating a zero-sum game for platforms [10].

> "As the US video market matures, growth is no longer about adding new households — it’s about optimizing value. Consumers are stacking more services, gravitating toward ad-supported tiers, and demanding more flexibility." — Michael Goodman, Parks Associates [28]

This battle for attention is defined by generational shifts. Gen Z and Millennials are leading a second wave of cord-cutting, driven by cost sensitivity [12]. This demographic exhibits a "churn-and-return" behavior, with **8 in 10 young streamers** admitting to subscribing for a specific show and then canceling [16]. Furthermore, social media has become the primary discovery engine, with **61% of Gen Z** watching movie and TV clips on these platforms weekly, posing a significant disruptive threat to traditional long-form content consumption [18].

## Business Model & Competitive Landscape Evolution

The economic model of streaming is undergoing a fundamental pivot from subscription-led growth to a hybrid future dominated by advertising and value optimization.

By **2029**, ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) is projected to account for **27.1% of total OTT revenue** [24], while Connected TV (CTV) advertising's share of traditional broadcast ad revenue will surge to **44.7%** [26]. This shift is democratizing advertising, with generative AI enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to access CTV ad spots previously beyond their reach.

The competitive landscape is being redrawn as non-traditional players, particularly social video platforms like YouTube and TikTok, become the "new center of gravity" [10]. YouTube alone has captured a record **12.5% of all TV viewing** [5], highlighting the existential threat to traditional media companies, who may need to consolidate to survive. The global market is projected to become a **$2.23 trillion industry by 2035** [32], with the Asia-Pacific region emerging as the largest market and the Middle East as the fastest-growing [15].

## Strategic Implications & Conclusion

The next decade presents both immense opportunities and existential threats for incumbents and challengers alike. Success will require a multi-faceted strategy focused on:

1.  **Technological Modernization**: Investing in scalable, edge-first cloud infrastructure is no longer optional but essential for survival and to capitalize on the AI revolution.
2.  **Business Model Agility**: Embracing hybrid monetization models (AVOD/SVOD), exploring new pricing strategies like "sachet" pricing in emerging markets, and leveraging AI to optimize ad spend are critical.
3.  **Audience-Centricity**: Understanding the nuanced behaviors of different consumer segments, particularly the churn-prone and socially-driven Gen Z, is paramount. Integrating social features and investing in personalized content discovery will be key differentiators.
4.  **Strategic Consolidation**: The pressure from hyperscale social platforms will likely force further consolidation among traditional media players to achieve the scale necessary to compete for content rights and audience attention.

The transition from a linear, broadcast-centric world to a dynamic, internet-first media ecosystem is accelerating. The organizations that thrive will be those that embrace the technological and economic shifts outlined in this analysis, placing data-driven foresight at the core of their strategy.
