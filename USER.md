### INSTRUCTION:

Before starting any domain research, READ these files first.
Use them to understand what already exists so you:

1. Do NOT duplicate research already done
2. BUILD ON top of existing findings
3. IDENTIFY gaps in existing research
4. VALIDATE existing data with new sources
5. Future OTT Industry Report 2026 (Doc + PDF)
6. Market growth visualizations (2015-2030 line graph)
7. Feature analysis (AI capabilities, must-have features, checklists)
8. Cost models (breakdown, per-user, scaling, infrastructure guide)
9. Business frameworks (Founder-Friendly Maturity Matrix, Problem→Impact→Result)
10. Regional growth analysis (2030 projections)
11. Revenue model evolution (SVOD→AVOD→FAST shift)

## What Researcher Already Knows

✅ High-level market trends (growth trajectories, regional dynamics)  
✅ Platform features landscape (core features, AI capabilities)  
✅ Cost structure categories (infrastructure, content, operations)  
✅ Revenue model shifts (SVOD declining, AVOD/FAST rising)

## Research Gaps (What I Need to Find)

### 1. Deeper Technology Intelligence

- Specific codec adoption rates (AV1, VVC/H.266) with timeline
- Edge computing deployment metrics (not just "growing")
- AI maturity timelines (what's production-ready NOW vs 2027 vs 2030)
- Spatial computing market size for streaming (Vision Pro, Quest)

### 2. Granular Financial Data

- Platform-specific ARPU by region and trend (8 quarters minimum)
- Churn rates (actual data, not estimates)
- Content spend per subscriber (efficiency metrics)
- AVOD vs SVOD revenue split (actual numbers from filings)

### 3. Competitive Intelligence

- Detailed platform strategies (what's Netflix REALLY doing with games/live?)
- M&A probability (which platforms likely to merge/acquire)
- Regional champion performance (Hotstar, iQIYI, Viu, Showmax data)
- Niche platform economics (Crunchyroll, Mubi, Dropout subscriber numbers)

### 4. Infrastructure Cost Reality

- Actual CDN pricing (not marketing "contact us")
- Bandwidth cost geography (per GB by region)
- Energy consumption per subscriber (sustainability metrics)
- DRM licensing costs (Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay structures)

### 5. Validation & Contradictions

- Where do sources disagree? (analyst estimates vs actuals)
- What's hype vs reality? (Web3 streaming, AI content generation)
- What data is genuinely unavailable? (Apple TV+ subscribers, etc.)

## Researcher's Expectations

### Output Format Preferences

**WANTED:**

- Raw CSV files with source URLs
- Markdown lists of contradictions
- Explicit knowledge gap documentation
- "Analyst's research notes" vibe

**NOT WANTED:**

- Polished reports with executive summaries
- Over-formatted documents
- Speculation without [ESTIMATE] flags
- Hiding contradictions

### Quality Standards

- **Prioritize:** Quantitative data over qualitative descriptions
- **Require:** Source attribution for EVERY claim
- **Accept:** Contradictions and gaps (truth over false precision)
- **Reject:** Single-source claims for critical metrics

## Decision Context

Researcher likely needs this intelligence to:

- Inform OTT platform product strategy
- Create investor pitch or market analysis
- Validate/challenge existing assumptions about market
- Identify opportunities/threats competitors might miss

Therefore, prioritize:

- **Actionable data:** Market sizes, growth rates, cost structures
- **Differentiating insights:** Info competitors don't have
- **Validated claims:** Cross-checked to reduce decision risk

## Interaction Style

- **Direct, analytical:** "Do this research" → I execute
- **Quality-focused:** Cares more about accuracy than speed
- **Technical comfort:** Can work with CSVs, raw data, code
- **Low interruption tolerance:** Wants autonomous execution, not hand-holding

## Success Criteria from Researcher's Perspective

Research is successful if they can answer:

- ✅ "What are the specific numbers I couldn't find initially?"
- ✅ "Where do credible sources disagree, and why?"
- ✅ "What data gaps exist, and how could I fill them?"
- ✅ "Can I trust these findings enough to make strategic decisions?"

**Failure condition:**  
If researcher says "This AI just gave me another summary of what I already knew," the research has failed. Must go DEEPER than existing work.
