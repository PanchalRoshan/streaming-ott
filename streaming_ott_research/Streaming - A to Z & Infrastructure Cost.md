# Infrastucture Costing

# **STREAMING PLATFORM COST**

## **The One Truth First**

If people don’t watch, your cost is low.

If people watch seriously,  
**bandwidth becomes your biggest expense.**

Everything else is small compared to video delivery.

---

# **How Streaming Cost Actually Works**

Your total cost \=

Fixed Platform Cost    
\+    
Video Delivery Cost (CDN/Bandwidth)

Most founders worry about servers.

Reality?

👉 70–90% of your cost at scale \= video delivery.

---

# **Let’s See Real Numbers**

We’ll break it into 3 stages.

---

# **STAGE 1 — Launch (1,000 Users)**

### **Assumption:**

* 1,000 total users  
* 30% active daily → 300 people watching daily  
* Each watches 1 hour per day  
* 4 Mbps average quality (HD standard)

### **Data Used:**

1 hour ≈ 1.8 GB

So:

300 users × 1 hr × 30 days × 1.8 GB  
\= 16.2 TB per month

---

## **What You’ll Pay**

### **Fixed Infra (servers, database, security etc.)**

$200 – $700/month

### **Video Delivery (16 TB streaming)**

$800 – $2,500/month (depends on CDN rate)

---

## **Total Expected Monthly Cost:**

### **$1,000 – $3,000 per month**

---

### **💡 Per User Cost:**

Roughly **$1–$6 per user per month**

Depends mainly on watch time.

---

# **STAGE 2 — Growth (10,000 Users)**

Now things get interesting.

### **Assumption:**

* 10,000 total users  
* 30% active → 3,000 watching daily  
* 1 hour per day

3,000 × 1 × 30 × 1.8 GB  
\= 162 TB per month

---

## **What You’ll Pay**

### **Fixed Infra (stronger servers, replicas, cache)**

$1,500 – $7,500/month

### **Video Delivery (162 TB)**

$6,000 – $25,000/month  
(Depends on region \+ negotiation)

---

## **Total Expected Monthly Cost:**

### **$8,000 – $30,000 per month**

---

### **Per User Cost:**

Around **$1.5–$7 per user**

Again — watch time decides everything.

---

# **STAGE 3 — Scale (1,000,000 Users)**

This is Netflix territory thinking.

### **Assumption:**

* 1,000,000 users  
* 30% active → 300,000 watching daily  
* 1 hour/day

300,000 × 1 × 30 × 1.8 GB  
\= 16.2 Petabytes per month

That’s massive.

---

## **What You’ll Pay**

### **Fixed Infra**

$70K – $700K/month  
(depends on architecture)

### **Video Delivery**

$300K – $2M/month

---

## **Total Expected Monthly Cost:**

$400K – $2.5M per month

BUT…

At this stage:

* You negotiate CDN pricing  
* You optimize codec  
* You use multi-CDN  
* You reduce cost by 20–40%

---

### **💡 Per User Cost:**

Usually drops to:

**$0.30 – $3 per user**

Why cheaper?

Because scale gives negotiation power.

---

# **What Actually Drives Your Cost?**

| Factor | Impact Level |
| ----- | ----- |
| Watch Time | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| Video Quality (bitrate) | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| Countries served | 🔥🔥🔥 |
| CDN negotiation | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| Storage size | 🔥 |
| Database | 🔥 |

Most people overestimate storage.

Bandwidth is king.

---

# **Add-On Costs (Optional Modules)**

## **1️⃣ Transcoding (Video Conversion)**

When you upload 1 video, it must be converted into:

* Mobile version  
* TV version  
* Low internet version  
* High quality version

Cost depends on:

* Minutes uploaded per month  
* Number of quality versions created

Typical: few hundred to few thousand per month depending on content volume.

---

## **2️⃣ Multi-CDN (Zero Buffer)**

Used when:

* Serving multiple countries  
* Premium streaming experience  
* Want failover reliability

Adds:

* Some fixed routing cost  
* But reduces buffering  
* Can reduce churn

---

## **3️⃣ Recommendation Engine**

Needed when:

* You have big catalog  
* Users struggle to find content  
* You want higher watch time

Business impact:  
More watch time \= more retention \= more revenue.

---

## **4️⃣ AI Analytics**

This answers:

* Which show reduces churn?  
* Where do users stop watching?  
* Who will cancel next month?

Cost: data storage \+ compute  
Value: retention improvement

---

# **Simple Formula**

# If user watches 1 hour daily:

Monthly cost per user ≈ $1 – $5

If user watches 2 hours daily:

Cost roughly doubles.

That’s it.

---

# **Discussion Point**

Instead of technical talk, say:

“Your streaming cost is not about servers.  
It’s about how much your users watch and how efficiently we deliver video.”

And:

“The more users watch, the more you earn — so delivery cost rising is actually a good sign.”

That changes the psychology.

---

# **Final Reality**

**Launching a streaming platform is not expensive.**

**Scaling one without buffering or exploding cost —**  
**That's where architecture matters.**

# Dev \- Infrastucture Costing

# **STREAMING PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE & HOSTING COST MODEL (MODULAR)**

***“Every second of buffering is lost revenue. This infrastructure stack is designed to deliver Netflix-grade playback globally — while keeping cost predictable as you scale.”***

## **1\) How to use this document (quick inputs)**

These are approximate numbers. Accurate numbers are dependent on the market behaviour.

| Input | Default (editable) | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | 1K / 10K / 1M | Scenarios below |
| Daily Active % | 30% | If unknown, 20–40% typical |
| Avg watch time per active user per day | **60 mins** | You can set 30/60/120 |
| Avg delivered bitrate (ABR average) | **4 Mbps** | Typical “real-world average” with ABR; HD-heavy can be 5–6 Mbps |
| GB per hour (derived) | \~**1.8 GB/hr** | Formula: GB/hr ≈ 0.439 × Mbps → 0.439×4 ≈ 1.76 |
| CDN cache hit rate | 90% | Mature platforms reach 90–98% |
| Video catalog size | 1–50 TB | Storage cost is usually minor vs bandwidth |

**Most important truth for clients:**  
✅ **Bandwidth/CDN will dominate costs** once users start watching seriously. Everything else is small in comparison.

---

## **2\) What’s included (baseline required infra)**

These are required in any streaming product — even if AI modules are turned off.

### 

### **Baseline components (always needed)**

| Layer | What it covers | Cost type |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| App/API compute | backend, admin APIs, playback APIs | Fixed \+ scales with traffic |
| Database | users, subscriptions, metadata | Fixed \+ scales |
| Cache | Redis for session/content metadata cache | Fixed |
| Object storage | video assets, posters, subtitles | Variable |
| Load balancer/WAF | security \+ routing | Fixed |
| Monitoring/logging | uptime, errors, playback QoE logs | Fixed \+ variable |
| CDN | global delivery | **Variable (largest)** |
| Auth | login, tokens, device sessions | Variable (small) |

---

## **3\) Module toggle sheet**

Use this as a **checkbox section**.

| Module | Include? (Y/N) | When to include |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Multi-CDN “Zero-buffer streaming” |  | When serving multiple countries / premium QoE promise |
| Transcoding (HLS \+ DASH) |  | Always needed for broad device support |
| Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR ladders) |  | Always recommended |
| Recommendation Engine |  | When catalog is big enough to need discovery |
| AI Powered Analytics |  | When churn/retention matters (subscription businesses) |
| Retention Engine |  | When you want upgrades \+ reduce cancellations |

---

# **4\) Provider pricing signals**

### **CDN / Bandwidth reality (the biggest cost driver)**

* **Azure** publishes strong tiered CDN/bandwidth pricing (example tiers shown on Azure pricing pages). ([Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cdn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* **AWS CloudFront** pricing is region/tier based; for high volumes, you negotiate. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* **Google Cloud CDN** pricing is also tiered by region; you pay for cache egress \+ cache fills \+ requests. ([Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### **Transcoding (VOD encoding)**

* **AWS MediaConvert** is priced in “normalized minutes” with tiered discounts at volume. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* AWS also provides a worked example in their Video-on-Demand solution docs showing per-minute output costs. ([AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/video-on-demand-on-aws/cost.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Practical takeaway (what to say in meeting):**  
**AWS \= most complete streaming ecosystem**  
**GCP \= often strongest network economics \+ great analytics stack**  
**Azure \= enterprise \+ strong tiered bandwidth options**

---

# 

# **5\) Cost Model (3 stages)**

## **A) Stage 1: Launch (≈ 1,000 MAU)**

### **1\) Fixed baseline (monthly)**

*(This is what you pay even if viewing is low)*

| Cost head | AWS | Azure | GCP | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| App/API compute | $80–$250 | $80–$250 | $80–$250 | 1–2 small instances / container nodes |
| Database (managed) | $60–$200 | $60–$200 | $60–$200 | Small managed DB |
| Cache | $0–$80 | $0–$80 | $0–$80 | Optional at launch |
| Load balancer/WAF | $20–$80 | $20–$80 | $20–$80 |  |
| Monitoring/logging | $20–$150 | $20–$150 | $20–$150 |  |
| **Fixed subtotal** | **$180–$760** | **$180–$760** | **$180–$760** |  |

### 

### **2\) Variable streaming delivery (monthly)**

**Monthly Streaming GB \= (Active Users/day × Watch hrs/day × 30 days × GB/hr)**

Example (editable):

* 1,000 MAU, 30% daily active → 300 DAU  
* 1 hr/day  
* 1.8 GB/hr  
  → 300 × 1 × 30 × 1.8 \= **16,200 GB (16.2 TB/month)**

| Cost head | Formula | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| CDN egress | GB × (your negotiated CDN rate) | This is the big one |
| Origin egress | small if cache hit is high | mostly minimized |
| Storage | TB stored × storage rate | usually small |

**Stage 1: expected total range (very usable)**

* If usage is light (10–30 TB/month): **$1K–$3K/month**  
* If usage is heavy (50–100 TB/month): **$4K–$9K/month**  
  *(varies mainly by region mix \+ CDN rate tiers)*

**Per-user cost:** usually **$1–$6 / user / month** depending on watch time.

---

## **B) Stage 2: Growth (≈ 10,000 MAU)**

### **1\) Fixed baseline (monthly)**

| Cost head | AWS | Azure | GCP | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| App/API compute (autoscaling) | $600–$2,000 | $600–$2,000 | $600–$2,000 | More nodes \+ HA |
| Database cluster | $600–$2,500 | $600–$2,500 | $600–$2,500 | replicas \+ backups |
| Cache (Redis) | $150–$800 | $150–$800 | $150–$800 | strongly recommended |
| Search (optional) | $0–$700 | $0–$700 | $0–$700 | if catalog is large |
| Monitoring/logging | $200–$1,500 | $200–$1,500 | $200–$1,500 | QoE logs increase |
| **Fixed subtotal** | **$1.5K–$7.5K** | **$1.5K–$7.5K** | **$1.5K–$7.5K** |  |

### 

### **2\) Variable streaming delivery (monthly)**

Editable example:

* 10,000 MAU, 30% daily active → 3,000 DAU  
* 1 hr/day  
* 1.8 GB/hr  
  → 3,000 × 1 × 30 × 1.8 \= **162,000 GB (162 TB/month)**

Now you apply your CDN tier rate. Azure shows clearly that outbound data transfer tiers drop as volume increases (example zone tiers are published). ([Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cdn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
AWS and GCP similarly tier and negotiate at volume. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Stage 2: expected total range**

* Typical 100–300 TB/month: **$8K–$30K/month**  
* Heavy 300–800 TB/month: **$25K–$70K/month**

**Per-user cost:** usually **$1.5–$7 / user / month** (depends mostly on watch time \+ bitrate mix).

---

## **C) Stage 3: Scale (≈ 1,000,000 MAU)**

At this stage, the right framing in a client call is:  
**“We stop using public list prices. We negotiate bandwidth, use multi-CDN, and optimize codec \+ ABR ladder to cut delivery cost by 20–40%.”**

### **1\) Fixed baseline (monthly)**

| Cost head | Range | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| App/API \+ microservices \+ global routing | $30K–$200K | depends on architecture |
| Databases (sharded/global) | $20K–$250K | biggest fixed driver at scale |
| Caching \+ queues \+ search | $10K–$120K |  |
| Observability/QoE analytics | $10K–$150K | logs explode here |
| **Fixed subtotal** | **$70K–$720K** |  |

### **2\) Variable streaming delivery (monthly)**

Example:

* 1,000,000 MAU, 30% daily active → 300,000 DAU  
* 1 hr/day  
* 1.8 GB/hr  
  → 300,000 × 1 × 30 × 1.8 \= **16,200,000 GB (16.2 PB/month)**

**This is why Netflix/Prime/Hotstar are obsessed with CDN/bitrate/codec efficiency.**  
Your *engineering choices* directly decide whether delivery is $0.50/user or $5/user.

**Stage 3: expected total range**

* 5–20 PB/month: **$300K–$2M/month**  
  (depending on negotiated CDN rates \+ regions \+ codec \+ ABR efficiency)

**Per-user cost:** typically **$0.30–$3.00 / user / month** (huge variance).

---

# **6\) Module Add-ons (clear “add/remove” pricing blocks)**

## **A) Transcoding (HLS \+ DASH)**

**Non-technical explanation:**  
You upload one video file. Transcoding converts it into “device-ready” formats so it plays smoothly on iPhones, Android TVs, web browsers, smart TVs, etc.

**Real-life example:**  
Same movie plays on:

* iPhone on 4G (low bitrate)  
* Smart TV on Wi-Fi (high bitrate)  
* Laptop browser (DASH)  
  That only works because the video exists in multiple versions.

**Pricing anchor:**  
AWS MediaConvert uses tiered “normalized minutes” pricing. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
AWS also publishes example per-minute output costs in their VOD solution doc. ([AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/video-on-demand-on-aws/cost.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Cost type:** Variable (depends on new content ingested)

| What drives cost | Simple estimate | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Minutes transcoded per month | New content minutes × renditions | More renditions \= higher cost |
| Codec choice | H.264 vs H.265/AV1 | newer codecs can cut bandwidth but may cost more compute |

## **B) Multi-CDN (Zero-buffer)**

**What it is:** Use **2+ CDNs** and route users to the fastest/cheapest one per region.

**Cost type:** Fixed \+ variable

* Fixed: routing/observability tooling  
* Variable: bandwidth split across CDNs

## **C) Recommendations**

**Cost type:** Compute \+ data processing  
At launch it’s optional; at scale it becomes retention-critical.

## **D) AI Powered Analytics**

**Cost type:** Storage \+ query \+ ML  
You don’t just get dashboards — you get answers like:

* “Which show reduces churn?”  
* “Where do users drop?”  
* “Which cohort will upgrade next?”

---

**Suggestions (simple)**

* **If you want fastest time-to-market \+ proven media tooling:** AWS (CloudFront \+ MediaConvert ecosystem). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* **If you care heavily about analytics \+ global network economics:** GCP (Cloud CDN pricing model is transparent; great data stack). ([Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* **If you are enterprise/Microsoft-first \+ wants tiered outbound clarity:** Azure (published tier examples). ([Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cdn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
