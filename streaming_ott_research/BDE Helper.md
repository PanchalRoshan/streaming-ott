### **Objective of Call:**

Clarify business model before tech discussion.

---

### **Ask These:**

If they don’t know this clearly →  
Focus discussion on strategy, not product demo.

• Finalize monetization before building  
• Use scalable infra from Day 1  
• Track analytics from start  
• Plan CDN negotiation after 50TB/month
